Anchor Modeling is an agile data modeling technique that is specifically designed to handle evolving data structures. It is built around the concept of storing each attribute as a separate table, which allows for more flexibility when dealing with schema changes. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the data model must evolve and adapt to new requirements frequently.

## Key concepts
- Anchors: Entities and events.
- Attributes: Properties of anchors.
- Ties: Relationships between anchors.
- Knots: Shared properties.

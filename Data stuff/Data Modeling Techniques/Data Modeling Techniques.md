Data modeling is the process of applying formal techniques to organize information workflows through abstractions (data models). Some techniques are:
- [[Relational Modeling]]: The first modeling technique. Rigid but consistent and predictable.
- [[Dimensional Modeling]]: De-structured and domain-driven version of the relational model... But still rigid.
- [[Data Vault]] Modeling: Small rigid components leading to a flexible large data structure.
- [[Anchor Modeling]]: Highly decoupled approach to achieve flexibility, might be hard to maintain and document.
- [[Bitemporal Modeling]]: Focused on tracking states along time. Similar to git approach to track changes.
